I started by creating the html and css files and linking them to eachother in the html head.

I then created sections in html and linked them to the nav.

It took awhile to balance all the elements in the nav using flexbox and related functions and then moved on to designing the sections.

I used css and html classed to add borders to all the sections and added the images/links to the work section.

It took me awhile to get the titles over the photos to work the way I wanted but I got it done.

After that I moved on to the About section and Contact sections that took less time to figure out.

I added the hero last.

I then messed around with the media queries in css to make the page adapt to several sceen sizes.

Hope everything is to your liking!
